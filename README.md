# Welcome to my first web application 


#### **Synopsis**


#### **• About**

This is a web application used for my first project at Code Institute. This application is Front End only with some of the JavaScript logic included. 

The main theme of this web application is LARP-ing and it is a place where you can get all the pieces of information about LARP called "World Of Celts".

If you are new to LARP-ing or don`t even know what LARP is, you can navigate to a section "What is LARP?". 
The user is free to roam this web application and check out the story and characters, buy some LARP gear, check out the gallery, ask a question or if brave enough, simply apply! 

#### **• Overview of technologies used**

Technologies used for this web application are HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Flexbox and JQuery.

HTML5 and CSS3 were used for main structure and for design. Bootstrap was used for main navigation, submission form and to keep everything responsive as possible. 
    
JavaScript and JQuery were used for some animation, scroll functions and form submission.

#### **• Features**

Under a section "Contact" the user can fill out the form for registration or ask a question.

- User Based Features
	- Registration

#### **• Deployment**

First deployment of the project "World Of Celts" was on 9th of January 2018.
