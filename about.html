              The smallest group in Celtic society was the Fine. A fine is an extended family group that included grandparents and parents and their kids, and could include aunts, uncles, cousins and their kids. The individual was not important. The fine was a unit, and was treated like one person. Everything belonged to the fine. A person could not break the law. If a member of a fine broke the law, the fine was responsible. By the same token, there was no such thing as individual glory. The fine was victorious.<br>

            <p class="text-indent col-lg-6">
              The next step up was the clan. Each clan was made up of several fines. In some cases, a fine would be so large that it was a clan in itself. You were part of a clan for life and beyond. Clans went back many generations.

              Each clan had a leader. You did not inherit leadership from your father. Any male could be chosen as long as he had a blood relationship to the clan. Each clan expected certain things of their leaders. Leaders had to be strong warriors. They had to be able to work out disagreements with other clans and conduct trade and raids on neighboring clans. Most importantly, they had to be rich enough to throw really good festivals.

              In the society of the Iron Age Celts, the Nobles were landowners. They were warrior leaders. The nobles had slaves occasionally, but these were people captured in war. Most of the work was done by the peasants, and that left the nobles lots of free time.<br>  
            </p>
          <br>
            <p class="text-indent col-lg-6">
              When noble men were not off fighting, they were farmers. They spent time playing fighting games, games of chance, and board games. They hunted and swam and fished. They conducted trade. Men wore their swords and daggers at all times, for decoration and protection. What a noble woman could and could not do was clearly spelled out, although it varied from clan to clan. A noble woman could own property. She could choose her own husband. Women could become warriors, but few chose to do so. Most ran the household and raised the children. Women wore their thick hair in braids decorated with beads. They spent a spent a great deal of time on their personal appearance, much of it weaving jewelry into their braids.<br>

              The peasants were free to come and go. Unless they married out of their clan, or studied to become an artisan, a bard, a druid priest, or a warrior, they had no reason to venture very far from their homestead.<br>  
            </p>
          <br>
            <p class="text-indent col-lg-6">
              Along with hunting and fishing, the men did the heavy labor on the farms. They were wonderful farmers. The Celts invented a reaping machine, an invention that was copied by the ancient Romans. The reaping machine let them harvest more rapidly. With the reaper, they were far less likely to lose crops to an early frost. It also saved on labor. They stored grain in pits for the winter.The women gathered berries and other foods that could be harvested. They cooked and cleaned and sewed and looked after the children. Although they were busy, most women spent some time on their personal appearance. At night, everyone would collect in the big home that served them all.The girls helped their mothers, the boys helped their fathers. Around age 15, both boys and girls began to think of marriage. Most would marry someone they met at a clan festival. The tallest boys might be selected to train as warriors. Some might learn an artisan skill. Most would be farmers. With their free time, kids would play war games. Also popular was a game they played similar to field hockey.

              The warriors were not a social class of people. All the ancient Celtic people were warriors if they needed to be. Although most women stayed home, looking after the crops and the children, when their men went off to war, women could choose to train and fight as warriors if they wished.

              There were warrior schools in the world of the ancient Celts. A couple of those schools were run by women. But they were the exceptions. Most of the warriors were well trained men.

              You might hear tales of warriors running naked into battle with only a shield and a sword for protection. There was one tribe that painted their body blue and ran naked into battle. But most warriors wore some protection. The nobles wore chain mail, and carried a shield and a sword. Peasant's shields might be made of wood instead of iron, but they were covered in leather. Their weapons were made of iron.<br>  
            </p>
          <br>
            <p class="text-indent col-lg-6">
              Celtic warriors used many tricks to scare their opponents. The Celts were naturally tall, with blonde or red hair. They rode horses into battle, which not only gave them a fighting advantage, but made them look even taller. Many warriors wore bronze or wood helmets shaped with two horns, that made them look taller yet.

              Men put lime in their hair before a battle. Lime burns and acts as a bleach. It lightened their hair so it was even more blonde. The lime also stiffened as it dried. This gave the men a protective glowing crown. Just before entering a battle, musical horns were blown. Men beat their swords against their shields and screamed battle cries and insults at their opponents.

              The Celts like to chop off the head of the leader of their enemies. That head was cured and rubbed with oil, and nailed over the doorway, somewhat like modern hunters do with deer heads.<br> 
              If you were facing an army of Celtic warriors, you would see a seemingly endless field of tall, screaming scary looking god-like creatures with lime spiked hair glowing brightly in the sun, and severed heads hanging from their belts and wagons. It would have been a most terrifying sight. The Celts were not only fierce fighters. They looked and sounded like fierce fighters. They often won, sometimes without even entering into battle. Between trading and raiding, the Celts soon became rich.<br> 
            </p>
            <p class="text-indent col-lg-6" >
              Before long, the Celts had taken over nearly all of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Isle of Man. The other tribes in these areas either moved away, were killed in battle, or joined the Celts. When the ancient Celts ran out of other tribes to fight, they began to fight each other. Close relationships between clans did not stop them from raiding each other - stealing cattle and other wealth. This led to many a battle.
              <br>
              The ancient Celts had always fought as a clan, not as a people. Clans might team up against another clan or two, but they had never banded together totally to defeat one common foe.

              When the Roman army arrived, the Celts did not band together to fight them. The well organized Roman army found them easy prey. The Romans did not wipe out the Celts. But they did rule the Celts for many years.

              The Celts believed that demons and spirits were everywhere. They believed that omens and portents were everywhere. They counted on their priests, the druids, to keep them safe from trouble. The druids were responsible for all religious rituals, because the only person who could talk to a god was a druid.

              The druids were the soothsayers, the seers, the teachers, the doctors, the philosophers, and the lawyers in Celtic society. To become a druid, you had to study with the druids for at least twenty years. The druids had their own universities. There was a lot to learn.<br>  
            </p>
          <br>
            <p class="text-indent col-lg-6">
              The Celtic people went to the druids for everything. If a child was sick, you went to your druid, who might cure the child with medicine they made from a plant. If two fines were having a fight over a boundary, a druid would decide who was right and who was mistaken. If a raven flew over a homestead, the fine might want to know what it meant. To find out, you asked the druids.

              Druids were members of a clan like everyone else. They were highly respected, and powerful. Druids decided who could get married, who inherited, and established the honor price for each individual in their clan.

              Bard was a professional story teller, verse-maker and music composer, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or noble), to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.<br>

              Music was so important to the ancient Celts that a group evolved called the Bards. Brads were wandering singers, storytellers, and poets. If a bard made up a really nasty story about you, and put it into the form of a song or a story, what that bard was saying would be believed.
              In time, the Bards became as powerful as the druids (priests and teachers). The bards could destroy your reputation with a song.
